These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",

    "\n",
    "> On average, a movie will return about 3 times of the money invested in it. The median return rate is 2.5.\n",
    "This does not include movies with a budget less than 1 million USD which might have a higher return.\n",
    "The plot for the profitability is seen as skewed to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the next question we picked five arbitrary categories: Horror, action, comedy, thriller, and science fiction.\n",
    "We compared the  popularity of each of each based on voter count.\n",
    "The amount of people who voted must be at least 100 to form a valid sample size.\n",
    "The plots show that the average user will rate a movie 6/10 regardless of the genre.\n",
    "A certain genre does not guarantee a higher rating, there are probably other factors that do.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The study hs about 2500 samples for the first question and at least 350 for each plot in the second.\n",
    "It is possible that the missing values may have skewed the data in one direction or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We also did not study a particular director, cast, production studio, nor the runtime.\n",
    "Any of these parameters might have a significant impact on the metrics by which we measure movie success.\n",
    "For example we might be comparing short movies against long movies and then agaisnt even longer ones.\n"
